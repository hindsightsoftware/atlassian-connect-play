    <h2>Preparing for production</h2>

    <p>
        Here are a few steps you should go through to configure you add-on and your environment before deploying it in
        production.
    </p>

    <h3>Set your add-on key (and name)</h3>
    <p>
        By default the module defines an add-on key for you when in development. If you haven't done so, set your add-on
        key (and name) in the <code>application.conf</code> file:
        <dl>
           <dt><code>ac.key</code></dt>
           <dd>your add-on key, which is used internally as a key by Atlassian Connect.</dd>
            <dt><code>ac.name</code></dt>
           <dd>your add-on name, which is used to display the name of you add-on to end users.</dd>
        </dl>
    </p>

    <h3>Set your base URL</h3>
    <p>
        By default the base URL is computed by the framework. When deploying to a production instance you should define
        the <code>BASE_URL</code> environment variable which will then be used as the base URL for your add-on.
    </p>

    <h3>Set your RSA keys</h3>
    <p>
        By default (in dev) the module generates a key pair to use for signing OAuth request when communicating with the
        host application. Those key files must NOT be used in production.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead you should define them as environment variables on your production system:
       <dl>
           <dt><code>OAUTH_LOCAL_PUBLIC_KEY</code></dt>
           <dd>is your public key</dd>
           <dt><code>OAUTH_LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY</code></dt>
           <dd>is your private key</dd>
       </dl>
    </p>
